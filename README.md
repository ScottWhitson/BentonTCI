## **Benton County TCI 2040**

The Benton County 2040 Thriving Community Initiative (TCI) is a project in which the goal is to identify the core values and vision of the Benton County community. In order to identify community thoughts, the Thriving Communities Council conducted several surveys by  hosting public events throughout the County. At these events,  community members were asked to to share comments on what they like about where they lived and what they hoped to see in the future. 
 
This project, conducted by students and faculty at Oregon State University, was done to present the results of this survey. The presentation of the results was done in a geo-visual manner which displays demographic results by city or town. The map also contains a word cloud which shows key words which identifies what the community values.
