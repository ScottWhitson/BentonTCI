It used to almost never break 100, now it regularly does!  We need tons more shade trees so that the streets,  sidewalks, and houses don't get so hot.  Otherwise it's too hot to be outside.  Houses need more shade trees so we don't have to run as many fans or use A\/C, which burns fossil fuel and makes global warming worse.  The County and the Cities should do more to preserve existing trees and remove ivy from trees.  There needs to be more shaded bike paths and safer routes to access more areas (such as South Corvallis, Crescent Valley High School, and Albany).  Make sure streets connect, so that it's easier to catch the bus.  Don't subsidize free parking -- people should have to pay to use up pavement for parking.  Keep the cities dense -- don't allow more houses in rural areas (a.k.a. \"sprawl\"), and encourage 5 story apartment buildings in cities.  Eugene is sprawling and has air pollution.

Teach people that the number of humans keeps increasing, but that the amount of land remains constant.  Therefore land will get more expensive, and we need to make better use of land.  In England, San Francisco, Boston, and other places, people are happily living in apartments and rowhouses.  We need more non-single-family homes in the cities, and less houses in rural areas.  Change the zoning codes to increase density in the cities and forbid more homes in rural Benton County. (People living in rural areas drive tons more than those in cities and are responsible for much more pollution.)  2. Plant more shade trees immediately, since they take forever to grow.  Plant them on the SW side of houses, and to shade streets and sidewalks, so that when it gets even hotter in the future people can still do stuff outside once in a while.  Make sure every County park and bike\/exercise route contains shade trees. 3.  Don't use blacktop on roads, use something more pale that reflects light so global warming isn't increased.  4. It would help fight global warming if you encouraged your employees to telecommute or work four 10 hour days.  Fund treatment to treat drug abusers so that they stop stealing from homes and cars.

The 2040 initiative must NOT make assumptions about pressures of future growth as if it were an emergency that should lead us to the conclusion that it is time to abandon our values and the values of the previous generation. The 2040 initiative must change its rhetoric to exclude such concepts as the ìsky is falling,î ìhordes of climate change refugees are comingî, ìweíve got to make way for the big bad future.î  Or, at the very least, 2040 must give equal time to noting that Oregonians have faced population pressure in the past (constantly), and that the Oregon response has been to develop, adopt, and commit to land use planning that limits population growth in favor of preserving soil and water resources.

Oregon has proudly been a state of independently minded people who have brought incredible ingenuity and innovation to the region and nation. But as we move forward I strongly feel that if the strangle hold of the bureaucratic limitation continues we will find our county and region left in a never ending cycle of economic stagnation.   Business must be allowed to thrive! And to do so they must be allowed to truly innovate, and we all know that most regulations limit this. I would propose that we de-regulate and see if that inspires and cultivates a new serge of local innovation and prosperity and in turn, produces a truly sustainable community!!", "comment": null, "age": "35-44", "lat": -123.276327, "long": 44.570861, "city": "Corvallis", "ethnicity": "White", "language": "English", "gender": "Male", "income": "25k-50k" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.276327, 44.570861 ] } },

Benton County needs to adopt a resolution that commits it to multiculturalism.  2.  Every policy that is considered and every decision that is made must be asked the question:  Does this policy\/decision promote and further the cause of multiculturalism in Benton County?  3.  Benton County should set a goal that by 2040, the demographics (race, religion, socioeconomic status, etc.) of the county will look more like the demographics of the country (and where we are more diverse, specific metrics to increase that diversity further).  That means more non-white residents, more non-Christian residents, more international residents, more refugees, more LGBT residents, etc.  4.  Benton County needs to announce and promote this resolution to people across the country, to other communities, and to the state and federal government.  5. Benton County must work with the cities and other jurisdictions within its borders to instill multicultural values at all levels of government.  6.  Benton County must support other jurisdictions who want to embody the same values.", "comment": "The world is going to change.  The climate will warm, social programs will come and go, the economy will cycle up and down.  Only by working together can a community weather the challenges that face us.    One definition of multiculturalism: \"Multiculturalism\" is the co-existence of diverse cultures, where culture includes racial, religious, or cultural groups and is manifested in customary behaviors, cultural assumptions and values, patterns of thinking, and communicative styles.
